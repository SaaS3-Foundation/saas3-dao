Tutorial: How to Use SaaS3-DAO

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to use SaaS3-DAO. SaaS3-DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that incorporates features like token donations, lawsuit submissions, jury voting, and rewards distribution. Let's get started!

Step 1: Token Donation
Token donors can call the `receive` function from the Treasury pallet to contribute funds. The function can be accessed as follows:
```
Treasury.receive(origin, amount, category_type)
```
Make sure to replace `origin` with the donor's address, `amount` with the donation amount, and `category_type` with the appropriate category type.

Step 2: Submitting a Lawsuit
Users can submit a lawsuit by invoking the `submit_sue` function from the Court pallet. Use the following code to submit a lawsuit:
```
Court.submit_sue(origin, value, defendant, statement)
```
Replace `origin` with the user's address, `value` with the desired value, `defendant` with the defendant's address, and `statement` with the lawsuit statement.

Step 3: Jury Voting
The jury members can vote on a lawsuit by calling the `vote_sue` function from the Court pallet. Use the following code to vote on a lawsuit:
```
Court.vote_sue(origin, lawsuit_id, approve)
```
Replace `origin` with the jury member's address, `lawsuit_id` with the ID of the lawsuit, and `approve` with a boolean value indicating whether to approve or reject the lawsuit.

Step 4: Processing a Lawsuit
Jury members can process a lawsuit by calling the `process_sue` function from the Court pallet. Use the following code to process a lawsuit:
```
Court.process_sue(origin, lawsuit_id)
```
Replace `origin` with the jury member's address and `lawsuit_id` with the ID of the lawsuit to be processed. This step involves punishing the guilty party and distributing rewards to the jury members.

Step 5: Claiming Rewards
Jury members can claim their rewards by calling the `claim_rewards` function from the Treasury pallet. Use the following code to claim rewards:
```
Treasury.claim_rewards(origin, amount)
```
Replace `origin` with the jury member's address and `amount` with the desired reward amount to be claimed.
